Iâ€™m **Akash Rana**, a graduate student pursuing a **Master of Science in Computer Science** at **Case Western Reserve University**. My academic focus revolves around **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **intelligent systems**. Iâ€™m currently taking a wide range of AI/ML courses to deepen my understanding and broaden my capabilities in real-world problem-solving.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a **Full Stack Web Developer** at **GO Sky Aviation Pvt. Ltd.** in New Delhi, India, where I led the development of scalable eCommerce platforms using the **MERN stack**. This hands-on industry experience built a solid foundation in system architecture and software deployment.

My long-term vision is to **engineer an end-to-end smart home automation ecosystem** powered by **IoT and AI** â€” bringing intelligent living into everyday environments.

### ðŸ”¬ My Interests

### 1. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

I'm deeply passionate about building intelligent models that can learn from data and make context-aware predictions. My graduate coursework and research projects have focused on:

- **Predictive Movement Modeling using HMMs & DBNs**  
  Designed a sequential model to predict user actions in smart homes based on (location + activity) pairs. Used HMMs and DBNs to model transitions and improve automation accuracy.

- **Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using ConvLSTM**  
  Built a ConvLSTM-based deep learning model for classifying human activities from video sequences. Achieved strong performance on datasets like UCF50.

- **Diffusion Models for Generative Image Synthesis**  
  Developed a Variational Diffusion Model and trained it on MNIST/FashionMNIST datasets. Explored continuous-time noise scheduling and evaluated model performance via Bits-Per-Dimension (BPD).

- **Hybrid Recommender System (Collaborative + Content-Based Filtering)**  
  Built a modular movie recommendation system leveraging user/item similarities and content metadata using the MovieLens 100K dataset.

These projects reflect my enthusiasm for cutting-edge ML models, generative modeling, and temporal prediction systems.

### 2. Smart Home Automation (AI + IoT)

A major motivation in my academic and personal work is to design a **comprehensive smart home automation system**. I envision a home where appliances are controlled not just by sensors but by **predictive AI systems** that adapt to the user's habits and context.

My modeling of movement patterns and activity recognition lays the groundwork for this goal. I'm also exploring integrations with IoT hardware (like Raspberry Pi and ESP32) to bridge **machine learning models** with **real-time automation control systems**.

### 3. Full Stack Web Development

Before diving into AI research, I worked for over a year as a **Full Stack Developer** at **GO Sky Aviation Pvt. Ltd.** in Delhi. I was responsible for:

- Developing full-featured **eCommerce platforms** using **MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN)**
- Integrating dynamic product listings, secure payment gateways, and admin dashboards
- Ensuring responsive design and performance optimization for production

This role taught me how to manage real-world software projects end-to-end, handle deployment pipelines, and collaborate in agile teams.
